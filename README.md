# Coding-Challenge-6

Solutions will be added here for COding Challenge 6, as presented in Andrei Neagoie's <i>Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery</i> Udemy course.

Challenge 1: Testing problem solving by completing the challenge without reference to any outside code. Glad to have done so, but would have definitely sought a more elegant (and efficient) sorting method if doing it again without that no-outside-code restriction. Looking at other submissions, this was definitely a little bloated, though I hope I kept things fairly orderly and in a object-oriented structure.
